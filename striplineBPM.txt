A Stripine Beam Position Monitor (BPM) can be used to determine the location of a particle beam. The working principle is to replace a section of beampipe with a strip of some conducting material, typically 4 evenly distributed around a pipe-section. When a beam of charged particles passes, an induced mirror-current will follow it in the pipe-walls, inversely proportional to the distance to the beam. Thus, when the beam passes the stripline section, a voltage pulse will be measured, and its strength gives information about the beam's axial position (when comparing the output from two opposite strips). Two such setups perpendicular to each other then yield complete information about the beam position. Technically, the stripline will produce two voltage spikes: one when the mirror current reaches the start of the strip and one when it exits. This allows for some clever analysis methods which I will not cover in detail here but which can be read about online.
